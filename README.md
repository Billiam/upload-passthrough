# Upload Passthrough

Dumb utility to upload a file to a [Node File Manager](https://github.com/efeiefei/node-file-manager) host, and optionally
open it with another application at the same time.

## Why?

I'm using this as my Fusion 360 manufacturing external editor.

After post-processing a project, the gcode is automatically uploaded to my
Raspberry Pi CNCjs host's watch folder, and also opens the file in sublime for review if necessary.

This makes it feel a bit more like the "Upload to Printer" dialog in my 3D printing slicer and saves me a step.
